        Gaggle. Prior to this, we collaborated on another project headed \
        by one of the founders of the same company which involved \
        starting the project from scratch. As such we were involved in \
        the initial db design, api creation and front-end design. During this \
        tenure, we worked with technologies such as flask, \
        python, reactJs, redux, axios, sql, sqlite, postman etc. The \
