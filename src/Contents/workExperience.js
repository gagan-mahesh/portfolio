        "I interned at this startup for six months during my third year in college. My role involved leading a group of interns and \
        making sure the milestones set by the senior team were matched \
        on time. I worked as a front-end developer in this team and as \
        such my work involved using React Native, redux, axios, etc. \
        We were mainly focussed on creating the UI for an app called \
        Gaggle. Additionally we collaborated on another project headed \
        by one of the founders of the same company which involved \
        starting the project from scratch. As such we were involved in \
        the initial db design, api creating and front-end.During this \
        tenure, we got to work with technologies such as flask, \
        python, reactJs, redux, axios, sql, sqlite, postman etc. The \
        minimum viable product was completed and submitted.",
